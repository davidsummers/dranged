The DRANGE library is my version of a Range Library that
will use the Border/Element design.

The range is delimited by Borders (begin/end).

Each Border is an iterator and also has an element_before( )/element_after( ),
however it can't be derefenced.

The begin( ) border does not have an element_before( ).
The end( ) border does not have an element_after( ).

Each Element is and iterator and can also be deferenced to find the value of the element.  It has a border_before( )/border_after( ).

++Element past end is undefined behaviour.
--Element before beginning is undefined behaviour.

Each Element can be tested as a bool, when returned from algorithms that return
Elements, to see if the alorithm found an element value.
